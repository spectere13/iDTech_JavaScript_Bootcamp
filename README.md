# JavaScript Bootcamp
This folder stores my javascript projects and work from November 2021 to February 2022. It includes the basic fundamentals of javascript coding, at-work notes, and computational thinking. It provides examples and references for printing, functions, arrays, split, splice, slice, and more. Good reading!
